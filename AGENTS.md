## Project Overview


## What's going on here?

Currently, there is ongoing work called "Project Kei" to remake the entire application from scratch. The goal is to create a more modular and maintainable architecture.
This includes:

- A complete overhaul of the UI architecture
- Readable code for both AI and human developers
- Performance optimizations via unspaghettiing the codebase
- ...and more!

Keep in mind that Project Kei is not applied to the backend. It is well-structured already. The focus is solely on the frontend.
