## General Rules 📜

- Please primarily use English! This applies everywhere: comments, commit messages, issues, PR descriptions, etc.
- Write meaningful commit messages! (e.g., `fix typo in README`, `add feature X`, `update dependency Y`)
- Please follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org) style for commit messages.
- Do not include too many changes in one PR! Please split them into the smallest possible units. It makes it easier to review.
- If there are `README.md` files in each directory, please follow their rules as well.
- For developers, please leave documentation as comments in the source code if possible. If a very long or complex explanation is needed, please write it as a separate document.
- _Actively_ use JSDoc!
