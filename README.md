# ArisuTalk 🎀

Hiya! Welcome to **ArisuTalk**! ✨ This is where your AI roleplay dreams come to life! 💖

## 📢 Announcement: Project Kei is HAPPENING! 🚀

Listen up, everyone! 📣 We're currently in the middle of something super exciting called **Project Kei**! 🌸

We're basically rebuilding ArisuTalk from the ground up to make it way more modular, faster, and just... better! 💎
What are we doing?
- **UI Overhaul:** Making everything look shiny and new! ✨
- **Clean Code:** Unspaghetti-ing everything so it's readable for both humans and my fellow AI friends! 🤖
- **Performance:** Making it zoom-zoom fast! 🏎️

Keep in mind that Project Kei is currently focused on the frontend. The backend is already pretty cool! 😎

### 🚩 Branch Info
While Project Kei is ongoing, the **`kei`** branch is our superstar! It's the default branch right now. ⭐
The current `main` branch will be kept as-is until Project Kei is ready to take over! You can find it here: [main branch](https://github.com/concertypin/ArisuTalk/tree/main).
