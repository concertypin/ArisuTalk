# ArisuTalk Backend

This is the backend component of the ArisuTalk AI chat application.
Since there is no need to use server, it is empty yet.

# Developer's guide
- Make code stateless. It reduces trouble with container, auto-scale, etc.
- Put all of dependencies into `libs.versions.toml` version catalog.
